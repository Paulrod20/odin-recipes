    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>It really doesn’t get any easier than this and you don’t need much to make a lip-smacking good steak. We used 2 New York Strip Steaks (pictured below),
       each weighing 1 pound and 1 1/4″ thick. Keep in mind a thicker steak will take longer to cook through and a thinner steak will cook faster.</p>
    
    <p>Well-marbled steaks will give you the juiciest results. Our favorite steaks to cook on a skillet are:
        <ul>
            <li>New York Steak</li>
            <li>Top Sirloin Steak</li>
            <li>Ribeye Steak</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Season generously</strong> – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Preheat the pan</strong> on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Sear steaks</strong> – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Add butter and aromatics</strong> – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Remove steak</strong> and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
